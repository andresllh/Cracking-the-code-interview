# Problem 3.2 Stack Min
"""
I: Create a stack that has Min function that works in O(1) as well as push and pop in O(1)
D: Find a way to create a stack that can perform min, push, and pop in O(1) time complexity
E/A: Used Duke's 7 steps. This problem was discussed during class, so I had a similar approach to the problem.
	 While the syntax might not be correct for creating objects and its functions, the ideas are still there
	 this problem is written in something that resembles pseudo code. My approach for this problem was to create
	 a stack object that will be in the stack. This stack object will store the min value of the stack plus it's own data.
	 By storing the min value in the object, you are able to obtain O(1) time complexity for all 3 functions.
L: For this problem I utilized the structure that was given to us by the Professor. Since a stack can store any object you
   want to store in it. You are able to store any type of data when you push and have that be available in a O(1) response time.
